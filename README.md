# Merritt Baby App

A small application built as an RSVP platform for a baby shower and gender reveal. The main goals of the application were:   

1. Offer an area for guests to find party information, registry information, and contact information
1. Allow guests to create messages for the couple that would appear on the site or be private
1. Implement a voting system for guests to vote on the gender of the baby
1. Show the total votes for each to create some conflict and excitement!

## Learning Rails

My Merritt Baby App was built by following a collection of tutorials for beginner level Rails. The goal of the app (outside those listed above) was to become more comfortable with not only Rails, but MVC concepts as a whole. Understanding database relationships and opportunities was a tangential benefit of the project.

The bulk of guidance came from [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/). Along with this, my other primary resource was [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Between these two I was able to get a small application up and running with basic information and interactivity.

## One Year Later

It has been a year since this application was built, made live, then taken down. There is little to do with it now except archive it for later reference. There will most likely not be updates, but this may offer a glimpse of some beginner level, very early attempts at Rails development.
